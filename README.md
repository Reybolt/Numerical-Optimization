Numerical-Optimization
======================

This code was created when tutoring a student in Math 309 (Numerical Optimization) at Simon Fraser University (Surrey) in Fall 2014. The files which solve the line search problem are written by the instructor/TA of the course. 

The purpose of this repository is to have a building block for standard numerical optimization techniques which are commonly studied in University. 

The homework problems are also included so all that is needed to understand the code are the questions and the methods used.
